Using the [UN World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed) dataset, we can create a bar chart race graph with Matplotlib.

The initial data processing/cleaning code can be seen in [this notebook](./bar_chart.ipynb) and the animation code is in [bar_chart.py](./bar_chart.py)

The animation is created in [animated_graph.py](animated_graph.py)
